# MonitoringStudentsApp
An app that registers students using Spring Boot and React and that lists all
students present in the database.

The frontend features a big paper field titled "Add student",  two empty text fields, labeled 
student address, and student name. And a green "ADD" button.

I am working on implementing multiple types of users(student, professor, and admin).
